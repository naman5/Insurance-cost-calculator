# Insurance-cost-calculator
this programs calculates the heath insurance cost of an individual.
In this program we use the formula  (insurance cost = 250*age - 128*sex + 370*bmi + 425*num_of_children + 24000*smoker - 12500). 
Where sex = 0 for females and sex = 1 for males and smoker = 0(for non smoker) and smoker = 1 (for smoker).
so we create a function, "calculate_insurance_cost" with parameters (age, sex, bmi, num_of_children, smoker, name).
